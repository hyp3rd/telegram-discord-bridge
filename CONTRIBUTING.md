# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for being so interested in contributing to this bridge bwtween Telegram and Discord. I appreciate your willingness to share your knowledge and experience with me.

The goal of this projet is to automate the process of sending messages from Telegram to Discord and soon other sources. This project is still in its early stages and I am looking for smart contributors to help me improve it.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

One of the simplest ways to contribute is by reporting issues. If you encounter a problem with one of the tools, find a mistake in the documentation, or believe that a best practice needs to be updated, please open an issue on our GitHub repository.

### Submitting Changes

If you want to directly contribute to the project by adding new tools, updating documentation, or proposing new best practices, follow these steps:

- **Fork the Repository:** Start by forking the project repository into your GitHub account.
- **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch in your forked repository. It's good practice to name the branch according to the feature or fix you're implementing.
- **Make Your Changes:** Add, edit, or delete files in your branch to implement the changes you want to make.
- **Commit Your Changes:** Make sure to write clear, concise commit messages describing your changes.
- **Push Your Changes:** Push your branch and its new commits to your forked repository on GitHub.
- **Create a Pull Request:** Open a pull request from your forked repository to the main project repository. Please provide a detailed description of the changes you've made and the reasons behind them.

## Reviewing Pull Requests

Another way to contribute is by reviewing pull requests submitted by others. Look over the proposed changes, test them if possible, and leave feedback.
